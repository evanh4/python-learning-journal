# python-learning-journal
A repository to document my Python learning journey

About Me

My name is Evan Hickey, I am a West Valley College student and just switched my major to computer science. I have no previous experience in the subject but I am interested in computers and have built some in the past, so I wanted to give this major a try to learn more about computers. 

Goals for this course

My goals for this course are to learn more about how to code and how I can use this code in the future for work or personal use. 

My first python program

print, "hello world"
